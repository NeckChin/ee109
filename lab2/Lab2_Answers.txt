Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kHz", or "200 msec"

1: (4 points) Fill in the truth table for the circuit.

  A    B    |   Z
------------+------
  0    0    |   0
  0    1    |   1
  1    0    |   1
  1    1    |   1



2. (3 points) The circuit performs the same function as a OR gate.



3. (3 points) At approximately what frequency does it become impossible to
   see any blinking and the LEDs appear to be on all the time?

        Maxiumum frequency for blinking visible = 80 Hz
